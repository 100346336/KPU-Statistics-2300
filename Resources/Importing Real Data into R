# Goal: One line bits of code that load useful data for teaching stats.

# Peruse https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html and just attach any dataset
# eg for the dataset on cars
X <- mtcars

# you can also read data directly from any url which leads to a csv. For the StarCraft dataset use
X <- read.csv(url("http://summit.sfu.ca/system/files/iritems1/13328/StarCraft2ReplayAnalysis-1.csv"))
