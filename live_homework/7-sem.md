Standardize each dataset
In dataset 2, what proportion is associated with values below z = 0.05479849
Find the maximum z-score in dataset 3 for both variables (time at bin; proportion). Find the probability percentage associated with those z-scores in the upper tail. 
Create a general purpose function calculating the standard deviation manually. 
Compute the standard deviation manually for all of these data sets.
Create a general purpose function calculating the standard error of the mean.
Produce a barplot of the variable of interest in each of the three datasets. 
Create an error bar indicating the standard error of the mean on it.
