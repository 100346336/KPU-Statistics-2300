## In this optional Lab, let's revisit datasets from the exam: 

- Chimp preferring cooked foods: http://llorban.net/psyc2300/chimpcookingstudy.csv
- Emotional intelligence dataset: http://llorban.net/psyc2300/EI_score.csv
- Garbage in sustainable building dataset: http://llorban.net/psyc2300/garbage_disposal.csv

# Tasks

* Standardize each dataset
* In dataset 2, what proportion is associated with values below z = 0.05479849
* Find the maximum z-score in dataset 3 for both variables (time at bin; proportion). Find the probability percentage associated with those z-scores in the upper tail. 
* Create a general purpose function calculating the standard deviation manually. 
* Compute the standard deviation manually for all of these data sets.
* Create a general purpose function calculating the standard error of the mean.
* Produce a barplot of the variable of interest in each of the three datasets. 
* Create an error bar indicating the standard error of the mean on it.
