As part of this lab exercise, you will work with an actual data set that I cleaned up for you. 

## About the data: 

The dataset contains the data of a large heterogeneous sample of participants who completed the Hebrew version of the Disgust Scale Revised (DS_R), and provided various demographic variables. Participants were chosen from the general population, using a convenience sampling method. They were approached at various locations (e.g., shopping centres, transport hubs, and government buildings) during the period of 2011- 2012. The raw data is stored in a table form, in both SPSS and tab-delimited formats. The dataset may aid in understanding disgust in di erent cultural settings and the relationship between disgust sen- sitivity and demographic variables. More information about this dataset and the disgust sensitivity scale are attached here.

## Your challenge: 

* Import the data in R (read it directly from the url instead of manually adding it)
* Find out the names of the columns in this dataset. In addition to ways of doing this in class, you can also use the headegg or summaryegg functions. Try both to show that you can figure out how to use these functions
* Generate a histogram of the mean disgust scale variable with a bin size of 20, and make the graph title "Histogram of Disgust Sensitivity Scale"
* Create a new variable that contains the sum of all mean disgust scores
* Create a new variable that contains the sample size
* Compute the mean using the sum and sample size variables
* Use the meanegg function to double check your calculations
* Based on your judgement of the histogram, and the values of the mean and median, what is the shape of this distribution? Insert your answer as a comment in your R studio file
