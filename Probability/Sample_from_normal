# (draft!) Joe R excercise on topic of central limit theorem. 
# Here is some code that lets you try bringing smaller or larger samples from a normal distribution.

#histogram of means from 100 samplings of this normal distribution
N=100
Number_of_samples=100
SampledMeans=double()
for (i in 1:Number_of_samples){
  SampledMeans[i]=mean(rnorm(N,20,7))}
hist(SampledMeans, main=paste('histogram of ', Number_of_samples, ' means (Standard Deviation of means=', round(sd(SampledMeans),2), ')'))

#excercise: try changing N to a larger number in the above code and see what happens.
#Now try changing the number of samples (the number of times we collect samples of size N). Describe the difference between increasing N and increasing the number of samples.
#How do these results relate to the central limit theorem?
