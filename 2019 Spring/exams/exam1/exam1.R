## 2015 Warneken and Rosati
## ABSTRACT: Previous observational work revealed that transient populations in a sustainable building disposed of 
## waste more accurately when compared to patrons in a non-sustainable building. The current study uses an experimental 
## design to replicate this observed effect and to investigate whether or not the built environment influences motivational 
## factors to impact behavior. We find support that a building designed and built to communicate an atmosphere of sustainability 
## can influence waste disposal behavior. Participants in the sustainable build- ing used the garbage receptacle significantly 
## less and compensated by tending to select the containers and organics receptacle more, which actually resulted in more errors 
## overall. Our findings suggest that building atmospherics can motivate people to recycle more. How- ever, atmospherics alone 
## do not appear to be sufficient to elicit the desired performance outcome.

## 1. How many variables are there? (2 points for the code that displays the number of variables)


## 2. What are the names of the variabes? (2 points for the code that displays variable names)


## 3. What is the sample size? (2 points for the code that displays sample size)


## 4. What is the sum of all scores on all variables? (6 points for the code that displays the sum of all scores)


## 5. Generate 2 histograms: one for the "proportion correct" and one for the "time at bin" variables (6 points, output formatted histograms)


## 7. What is the mean, the old fashioned for both "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables? (4 points, display the value)


## 7.b. Validate your answer (in other words, use a completely different function to get the same answer) (2 point)


## 8. What is the median of "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables (use the R function, new fashioned way)? (2 points for the code that displays the value)


## 9. What is the mode of "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables, using the old fashioned way (4 points for the code that displays the value)


## 6. Based on the shape of the histograms, and the locations of the means, medians and modes, 
## what can you conclude about the shape of each distribution? (4 points, add comments as a hashtag remark)


## 9. What is the range of scores of the "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables?  (4 points for the code that displays the value)


## 10. Center both "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables (4 points points for the code that displays the value))


## 11. Compute the sums of squares for both "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables, the old fashioned way (6 points for the code that displays the value)


## 12. Compute the variance of both "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables, the old fashioned way (4 points for the code that displays the value)


## 12.b. Validate your answer (in other words, use a completely different function to get the same answer) (2 points)


## 13. Compute the standard deviation for both variables, the old fashioned way (4 points points for the code that displays the value))


## 13.b. Validate your answer (in other words, use a completely different function to get the same answer) (2 points)


## 14. Compute the covariance of the two variables, the old fashioned way (4 points)


## 14.b. Validate your answer (in other words, use a completely different function to get the same answer) (1 point)


## 15. Compute the correlation coefficient, r, between the "proportion correct" and "time at bin" variables. (4 points for the code that displays the value)


## 15.b. Validate your answer (in other words, use a completely different function to get the same answer) (1 point)


## 16. What conclusion can you draw from the correlation answer in 15? (6 points, add comments as a haghtag remark)
